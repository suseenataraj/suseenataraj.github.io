<h4>VULNERABILITY SCANNING</h4>
<p>My first post is about vulnerability scanning which I used to do during my free time and it is something I do out of my interesting. So what <b>vulnerability scanning</b> is????</p>
<p>The vulnerability scanning process involves an application that scans and creates an inventory list of all the present systems on a network. This application is called a vulnerability scanner, and the systems it can scan are servers, laptops, desktops, containers, virtual machines, switches, firewalls, and printers.  

Under the systems vulnerability scanning, the scanner attempts to log in to the system as well. It uses the default or other specified credentials to gain access to different systems and draw a more detailed picture.

The vulnerability scannerâ€™s final inventory list highlights the list of systems on the network and the vulnerabilities found in them.</p>
